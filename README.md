# MNIST tensorflow
Just an ordinary project for trying TensorFlow

MNIST is dataset that has been widely use for machine learning beginning (many said it is "hello world" for computer vision).
It is a single digit handwritten dataset that release since 1999.

This is my first public GitHub project for trying TensorFlow with MNIST dataset.

## Architecture

2 layers of convolutional neural network and fully connected layer in the last one. (Similar architecture in [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros)).

## Result

Accuracy: 98.543%
